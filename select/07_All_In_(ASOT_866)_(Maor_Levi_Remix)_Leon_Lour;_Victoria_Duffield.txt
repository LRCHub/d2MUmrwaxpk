We're only losing time
To question what feels right
It's building from inside
Unspoken dynamite

Oh no, we don't need to speak at all
Follow me and the pieces start to fall
Let go and let me take away your fear
No words, but I hear you loud and clear

All in, don't think so much
All in, and let us make the most of it
All In, make the jump
Talking ain't no fun

Oh no, we don't need to speak at all
Follow me and the pieces start to fall
Let go and let me take away your fear
No words, but I hear you loud and clear

All in, don't think so much
All in, and let us make the most of it
All In, make the jump
Talking ain't no fun
All in
